First part of the task where the game is being played in a browser was the first time for me to write JS working code on my own. It revealed minor confusion on my part, but I managed to rewrite the code quickly and make the game work. It was a great way to solidify JS theory gained from previous lessons.

Creating second part of the game with UI was a great way for me to refresh and expand my CSS knowledge. I truly enjoy finding new ways to improve the visual side. Whole design can definitely be more polished but that was the very first idea I had in my mind and as I am still learning I want to make sure to keep on moving forward and eventually create new more sophisticated projects. On JavaScript side whole thing took very little time to write and the game seems to be working in its basics.

I felt like this game could use a little bit more polishing so decided to add sounds effects on game outcomes and game weapons. As well as changing and animating "Game over" sign.
